# Eng-Chi-Project

This documents a few of my attempts to train a translator from English to Chinese using 10,000 paired sentences obtained from https://corpus.eduhk.hk/paraconc/, and architectures based on keras code examples. In short, I tried a few different methods involving an LSTM, which I was not able to train to a meaningful level. Eventually, I switched to a transformer-architecture, which I was able to train on my personal machine to the point that it could approximately translate very basic sentences.
